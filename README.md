# VoiceAI
An AI voice assistant

# Story of the app
Once I thought to create an AI voice assitant, and here we are.
It's created by me and AI, I mostly troubleshooted tho, AI had the idea of using gtts for managing text-to-speech and vice versa functions,
while I after understanding that we need paid plan for openai API, I had the idea to look for AI no register in google, and then I just captured and copied the request from networks tab after asking smth to AI,
yes also I handled the response handling.

# Installation
